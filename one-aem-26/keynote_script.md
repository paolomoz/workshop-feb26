# Keynote Script: What I Learned at the One AEM Workshop

_~4 minutes. Spoken delivery. For the team._

---

Let me tell you about the workshop I just came back from.

I sat in a room with every director and above in AEM. The topic? How to become an AI-native organisation. And I walked out with one thought that I can't stop thinking about.

We're not trying to work harder. We're trying to work at a completely different level.

Let me explain what I mean.

Right now, most engineers -- and I include us in this -- use AI the way you'd use a calculator. You pull it out when you need it, you get an answer, you put it away. That's Level 1. That's where the industry is.

But there's a Level 2, where AI is the first thing you reach for. Not sometimes. Every time. Before you Google it. Before you ask a colleague. You ask AI first.

And then there's Level 3. This is where it gets interesting. At Level 3, you've rebuilt your entire workflow around AI. You're not using AI as a tool anymore. You're managing a fleet of agents. You design the plan. You decompose the work. You verify the output. But you don't write the code. The agents do.

There's an engineer at Anthropic named Boris Cherny who shipped over 300 pull requests in December. Three hundred. In one month. He didn't do it by working nights and weekends. He did it by running 10 to 15 Claude Code sessions in parallel. He'd give each one a plan, let it execute, and review the results. His job wasn't coding. His job was managing agents.

That's Level 3. And that's where I want every one of us to be.

But here's the twist. There's a Level 4. And Level 4 isn't "everyone is Level 3." Level 4 is when the team itself is AI-native. When we have shared tools, shared pipelines, shared norms that make this way of working the default. When a new person joins and reaches Level 2 in their first week -- not because they're exceptional, but because our infrastructure carries them there.

That's the target. Level 4.

Now. How do we get there?

Three things came out of the workshop that I think change everything for us.

First: we have permission to be pirates.

I'm not being metaphorical. This was said explicitly, at the director level, endorsed across the organisation. Break the rules. Use what you need. See a tool that would make you faster? Expense it. Don't wait for procurement. Don't ask for a committee. Just do it.

The number one reason innovation dies in big companies is that people are afraid of getting in trouble. That fear is officially gone. We are pirates. And pirates have fun.

Which brings me to the second thing.

This transformation has to be fun. Not stressful. Not exhausting. Fun.

We are already ahead of most of the industry. We're above the company average. The next leap isn't about putting in more hours or more effort. It's about doing things differently. Or not doing them at all.

Everything we can delegate to AI, we delegate. Everything we can automate, we automate. The goal is to spend our time at the highest level of thinking we're capable of. Designing. Planning. Judging. Creating. Not grinding through tasks that a machine can handle.

If this transformation feels like burnout, it failed. I don't care how much output we produce. If we're not enjoying it, we're doing it wrong.

And third: we should think of ourselves as an applied research team.

This idea came from the Cursor team. They see themselves as researchers who study how to improve their own job -- and then ship the results as product. Every tool they build internally becomes a product insight. Every workflow they optimise becomes a feature candidate.

We can do the same thing. Every automation we build for ourselves, every pipeline, every shortcut -- that's not a side project. That's applied research. We're researching how AI-native engineering actually works, and the answers we find will inform what we build for our customers.

So here's what I want us to do.

At our workshop on February 9th, we're going to assess ourselves honestly. Where is each of us on that Level 1 to 4 scale? And where do we want to be by mid-year?

We're going to co-create our team culture together. Not top-down. Together. We'll start with what Anthropic does -- AI-first, push boundaries, write and share, fail fast, stay skeptical -- and we'll add what's missing for us. Build for the team. Make work visible by default. Have fun doing it. Elevate, don't grind.

And we're going to build something. Live. Together. We'll pick one of the automation ideas that came out of the workshop and prototype it as a team. Not a slide deck. Working code.

Everyone will close the day with two sentences. One: what's the first thing you'll focus on to level up your AI skills? Two: what's your stretch goal for the end of the year? It has to be a stretch. If it doesn't scare you a little, aim higher.

Those two sentences will be our commitments. Public. Tracked. Celebrated.

I'll leave you with this.

The question from the workshop that stuck with me the most came from Amit. He asked: "We're doing the right things. But are we moving fast enough?"

I think the answer is: not yet. But we have everything we need. We have the permission. We have the tools. We have each other.

Let's go be pirates.
