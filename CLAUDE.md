## Skills

### Note-Taking: Workshop Highlights
When the user shares raw workshop notes, follow the processing rules in [`one-aem-26/NOTE_TAKING_SKILL.md`](one-aem-26/NOTE_TAKING_SKILL.md). Classify, structure, connect, suggest, and write to `one-aem-26/highlights.md` immediately. Read the skill file at the start of each conversation involving workshop notes.

### Audio Production: Fireside Chat
When the user asks to generate a fireside chat or audio dialogue from a document, follow the processing rules in [`one-aem-26/FIRESIDE_CHAT_AUDIO_SKILL.md`](one-aem-26/FIRESIDE_CHAT_AUDIO_SKILL.md). Write a casual conversational script, generate audio via ElevenLabs Text-to-Dialogue API, and merge into a single MP3. Read the skill file at the start of each conversation involving audio generation.
